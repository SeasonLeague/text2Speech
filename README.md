# TEXT2SPEECH #
### Just a simple implementation of a text-2-speech in javascript 

#### Currently i can give it `60%` but it's not all that great
---
### HOW TO USE?
---
* First click on this [link](https://speech-two-xt.netlify.app/)
* Then start talking and don't stop talking because it uses your mic.
* So what happens is that it calls your mic to be on and normally when the mic starts reading for some while without voice inputs it will stop but in that case, when it stops, just use the `copy button` and copy the text then refresh the web page.
* It's pretty much accurate and picks only one voice from the background.
# Thanks.

## REASON FOR THIS PROJECT
Just for fun and for work, when you have sooo many things to type, why type it when you can just automate things as a dev that you're becoming :smiley: :grin:
